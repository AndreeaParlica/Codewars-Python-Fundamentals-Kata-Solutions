# In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will
# consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference
# of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.
#
# For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20.
# Therefore, the function should return 8.
#
# Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

def find_difference(a, b):
    # maxim = max((a[0]*a[1]*a[2]), (b[0]*b[1]*b[2]))
    # minim = min((a[0]*a[1]*a[2]), (b[0]*b[1]*b[2]))
    # return maxim - minim
    return (max((a[0]*a[1]*a[2]), (b[0]*b[1]*b[2]))) - (min((a[0]*a[1]*a[2]), (b[0]*b[1]*b[2])))

print(find_difference([3, 2, 5], [1, 4, 4]))
